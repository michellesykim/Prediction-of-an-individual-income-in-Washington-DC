This repository will predict the individual income of a census tract based on the household income and incarceration rate

# Background Information
From my first mini project, I explored the relationship between parents' income and the incarceration rate in Baltimore, MD and Washington, DC. And based on my analysis, it was true that lower income parents (childrens' financial circumstance) lead to a higher incarceration rate of their children in both areas. Now, I wanted to explore how the high incarceration rate and the low household income (also represents children's financial circumstance along with parents income) together would affect the children's future individual income specifically in Washington, DC (Baltimore, MD had a small number of data). Like cycle of poverty, if it is true that one ends up earning a lower income after jail, one would have a higher possibiilty of raising their children under lower household income, then this would again lead to higher chance for one's future children to be incarcerated. Not only exploring the relationship among the incarceration rate, individual income, and household income, I wanted to see if both incarceration rate and household income are significant enough for predicting the individual income in each census tract and to see whether the linear relationships are postiive or negative: Do high incarceration rate and low household income lead to low individual income in Washington, DC?

# Business Question
Can we predict social mobility (individual income) of a census tract?

# Data Question
Can we predict individual income in Washington, DC (using census tracts) based on one's incarceration rate and household income?

R^2 value tells us how well the linear regression line predicts the outcome data. Here, the R^2 value is approximately 0.94, which means 94% of the individual income data in Washington, DC can be explained by the incarceration rate and household income.

Next, standard error measures the spread of the data around the linear regression line. Here, the standard error value is about 1716.58, which means approximately 68% of the predictions for individual income are accurate within one standard error ($1,716.58) and 95% of the individual income prediction is accurate within two standard errors ($3,433.16).

Coefficients give the best fitting estimate of the multiple regression line. Here, the the multiple regression line is **Individual income = 12,507.04 - 22,326.22*Incarceration rate + 0.467*Household income.** If incarceration rate increases by 0.001, the individual income will decrease by $223.3. Also, when there is an increase of $1,000 in household income, the individual income would increase by $467. And the coefficient of the intercept (12,507.04) is theoretically the expected mean value of individual income when all the dependent variables are zero. Thus, in total, if the incarceration rate increased by 0.001% and the household income increased by $1000, this will result an individual income of $12,750.74.

P-value is the probability that the null hypothesis is true. Here, both incarceration rate and household income have a p-values lower than 0.05. Thus, both independent variables are significant in predicting the individual income but especially, household income has a lower p-value so it is more significant in predicting the outcome.

Significance F value indicates the probability that none of the independent variables matter. Thus, here, F value of 1.1777E-109 means thereâ€™s almost no case where household income and incarceration rate are not important for predicting the individual income.

Correlation between two variables is the strength of the linear relationship. Here, the correlation between the individual income and the household income is 0.97, which shows a strong positive linear relationship. Also, the correlation between the individual income and incarceration rate is -0.76 which also shows a negative linear relationship between the two variables. Looking at the absolute values of the two correlations, individual income has a stronger linear relationship with household income. 

# Summary
R^2 square value being 0.94 and both p-values of incarceration rate and household income being less than 0.05 indicate that both incarceration rate and household income are good predictors of the individual income in Washington, DC. Based on the coefficients value of the multiple regression line, **Individual income = 12,507.04 - 22,326.22*Incarceration rate + 0.467*Household income**, we can see that incarceraiton rate and individual income are negatively related and the household income and individual income are positively related. This not only shows that we can actually predict social mobility of a census tract, but also supports my assumption that low household income and high incarceration rate will lower the individual income. Between the two independent variables, household income has a more significant impact on the outcome due to its high correlation with the dependent variable, its lower p-value, and its R^2 value for simple regression line. This result is important to me since it shows that there is some kind of never ending cycle going on among low individual income, low household income, and high incarceration rate. For instance, parents with low income has a higher chance for their children to be incarcerated (result from project 1) -> and for those children, after jail, they are likely to have low individual income -> when those children become parents, there is a high possibility that they are parents with low income or part of the low household income -> then this will again lead their future children to be incarcerated with a high posiibility. Knowing that there could be a some kind of cycle going on among these variables would allow us to identify diffrent kinds of social issues going on in our community, especially in Washington, DC. And if we are able to find effective solutions, the multiple regression line could have a totally different form in the future! For additional information, it would be helpful to know why low household income and high incarceration rate actually leads to a low individual income. Here, I quantified the realtionship among those variables, but it woud be helpful if I can know the real reason behind those outcome. Is it because they did not have enough financial resource to educate their children? Or is it because of pervasive discrimination of people out of jail in the community? Idenfifying these causes and providing solutions would definitely help reducing or increasing the coefficients of the multiple regression line.
